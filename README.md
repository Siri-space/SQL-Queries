# SQL-Queries

These are some Complex SQL queries that are essential for handling real-world scenarios where data is diverse, interconnected, and dynamic. They enabled me to extract valuable insights, maintain data integrity, and meet the requirements of complex business processes.

1. Simple Select Statements:
Explanation:

Simple select statements are the foundation of SQL queries. They retrieve data from one or more tables.
Use Case:

Useful for basic data retrieval when you want to see all columns or specific columns from a table.

2. Joins:
Explanation:

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
Use Case:

When you need to fetch data from multiple tables and combine it in a meaningful way. For example, retrieving customer information along with their order details.

3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
Explanation:

CTEs are named temporary result sets that can be referred to within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
Use Case:

Useful for breaking down complex queries into simpler, more readable parts. For example, extracting high salary employees from a large dataset.

4. Window Functions:
Explanation:

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.
Use Case:

When you need to calculate running totals, averages, or other aggregate functions over a specific window of rows, such as calculating the running total of salaries within each department.

5. Subquery:
Explanation:

A subquery is a query nested inside another query.
Use Case:

When you need to perform a query that depends on the results of another query. For example, finding employees with salaries greater than the average salary.

6. Derived Tables:
Explanation:

Derived tables are tables created within the FROM clause of a query.
Use Case:

Useful when you want to use the result of a subquery as a table in the main query. For example, selecting employees with salaries higher than a threshold.

7. Views:
Explanation:

Views are virtual tables based on the result of a SELECT query.
Use Case:

When you want to simplify complex queries or provide a simplified interface for users. For example, creating a view for high salary employees.

8. Stored Procedures:
Explanation:

Stored procedures are precompiled collections of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit.
Use Case:

When you have a set of SQL statements that need to be executed together. For example, creating a stored procedure to retrieve employee details based on an ID.
Each of these SQL concepts serves a specific purpose in solving different problems, ranging from basic data retrieval to handling complex data manipulations and business logic. The choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements of your task or application.
